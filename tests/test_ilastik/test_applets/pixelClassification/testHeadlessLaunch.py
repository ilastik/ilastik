"""
This is a minimal test to ensure that the app can be launched in headless mode, create a project, and exit cleanly.

In particular, this test should fail if a developer has accidentally added a GUI module import statement
(such as "import qtpy") in a place that might be reached during "headless mode".
In headless mode, such import statements will fail, and so will this test.

NOTE: This test only works properly
