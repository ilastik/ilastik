lazyflow developer documentation
====================================

Lazyflow is a python library for multithreaded computations.
Data dependencies are expressed as a data flow graph which is evaluated
in a lazy manner.
I.e. when the user requests a result or a small part of a result only the computations necessary to 
produce the requested part of the result are carried out.
